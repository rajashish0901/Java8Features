 A stream is a sequence of elements from a source that supports data processing operations.

 Streams make use of internal iteration: the iteration is abstracted away through operations such as
filter, map, and sorted.

 There are two types of stream operations: intermediate and terminal operations.

 Intermediate operations such as filter and map return a stream and can be chained together. They’re
used to set up a pipeline of operations but don’t produce any result.

 Terminal operations such as forEach and count return a nonstream value and process a stream
pipeline to return a result.

 The elements of a stream are computed on demand.

Collections are data structures, they’re mostly about storing
and accessing elements with specific time/space complexities . But streams are about expressing
computations such as filter, sorted, and map that you saw earlier.

The Streams API lets you express complex data processing queries. Common stream operations are
summarized in table 5.1.

 You can filter and slice a stream using the filter, distinct, skip, and limit methods.

 You can extract or transform elements of a stream using the map and flatMap methods.

 You can find elements in a stream using the findFirst and findAny methods. You can match a given
predicate in a stream using the allMatch, noneMatch, and anyMatch methods.

 These methods make use of short-circuiting: a computation stops as soon as a result is found; there’s
no need to process the whole stream.

 You can combine all elements of a stream iteratively to produce a result using the reduce method, for
example, to calculate the sum or find the maximum of a stream.

 Some operations such as filter and map are stateless; they don’t store any state. Some operations
such as reduce store state to calculate a value. Some operations such as sorted and distinct also
store state because they need to buffer all the elements of a stream before returning a new stream.
Such operations are called stateful operations.

 There are three primitive specializations of streams: IntStream, DoubleStream, and LongStream.
Their operations are also specialized accordingly.

 Streams can be created not only from a collection but also from values, arrays, files, and specific
methods such as iterate and generate.

 An infinite stream is a stream that has no fixed size.
